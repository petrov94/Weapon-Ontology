# Weapon-Ontology

This project implements a Weapon Ontology using Apache Jena, providing a structured hierarchy representation of various weapons and their attributes. The ontology categorizes different types of weapons, detailing their characteristics and relationships. Apache Jena is employed to create  this ontology, allowing for efficient retrieval and manipulation of weapon-related data.
